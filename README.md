# Tender Tummies API

This is an API for the Tender Tummies FPIES database. This API will allow user to GET/POST/PUT/DELETE items from the Tender Tummies Database. This API is seeded with a dummy child's information, the actual database is not uploaded at the moment.

It uses .NET Core and SQLite.

# Installing Bangazon API

There are a few things you need to make sure are in place before the database can be up and running.
 1. Fork and clone the repo on to you local machine. 
 2. Run `dotnet restore`
 3. Run `dotnet ef database update` 
 4. Run `dotnet run` 
 > This will compile and run everything as well as initalizing the database with some data to get started

## Using the API
All calls to the API will be made from `http://localhost:5000` as the domain. All calls will be made from here. After the instructions, an example will be given using the dummy user and child seeded in the database.
